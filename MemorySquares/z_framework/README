the main folder (z_framework) provides a few modules that can be used separately, except for zf_common.

zf_common : provide stuffs that I commonly used.
zf_sfml : provide the stuffs that make use of sfml.
    |_ animations : some simple animations code.

The template folder (template) provides a starting point for most of my game. It provides the Makefile for compilation, the setup for screens and commonly input/event handling code.

The best way to use this is to create a new project using the template folder, and copy z_framework into the root of the new project folder. 

The final look should look something like 

template 
    |_ z_framework
        |_ zf_stuffs
    |_ main.cpp
